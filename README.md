# W3C TPAC Template

I always forgot that in the [Template page](https://www.w3.org/2025/Talks/TPAC/Templates/) (from [TPAC Speaking guidelines](https://www.w3.org/2025/11/TPAC/speaking.html)), tapping "user manual" in the first page brings up a hidden section, where [zip file](https://www.w3.org/2025/Talks/TPAC/Templates/TPAC-2025-slides-template.zip) is provided.

Forking from GitHub is much easier.

## How to export slides as PDF

The only way I successfully export the correct format on the Mac:

1. Use Firefox, tap "Print…"
2. **Tap "Print using the system dialog…"**
3. **Change "Paper Size" to Custom Papers - "W3C_TPAC_Template"**
4. Make sure "Orientation" is "Landscape"
5. Tap PDF - "Save as PDF…"
